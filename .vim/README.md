There's a few steps to make this working

I'm assuming here that this repo is already cloned and .vim & .vimrc moved to $HOME.

First, let's install Vundle by running `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim` then start vim and run `:PluginInstall`

Then, your vim configuration is almost done.

You just need to install `exuberant-ctags` to make tagbar working.
